### 7. Compare the Multiplexer and Demultiplexer

**Multiplexer (MUX)**

- **Definition**: A multiplexer is a digital circuit that selects one of many input signals and forwards it to a single output line.
- **Input/Output**: It has multiple input lines (2^n) and a single output line.
- **Function**: Acts as a data selector, consolidating multiple inputs into one output.
- **Applications**: Used in communication systems, data routing, etc.

**Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**

- **Definition**: A demultiplexer takes a single input signal and distributes it to one of many output lines.
- **Input/Output**: It has one input line and multiple output lines (2^n).
- **Function**: Acts as a data distributor, routing a single input to multiple outputs.
- **Applications**: Used in data distribution systems, signal routing, etc.

| Feature | Multiplexer (MUX) | Demultiplexer (DEMUX) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Definition | Combines multiple inputs to one output | Distributes one input to multiple outputs |
| Input/Output | Multiple inputs, one output | One input, multiple outputs |
| Function | Data selector | Data distributor |
| Applications | Communication systems, multiplexing | Signal routing, data distribution |

### 8. Illustrate Working of Half Adder and Full Adder Logic

**Half Adder**

A half adder adds two binary digits and produces a sum and carry.

- **Inputs**: A, B
- **Outputs**: Sum (S), Carry (C)

**Truth Table for Half Adder**


| A | B | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

**Logic Circuit for Half Adder**

```
        A -----
              |
              |   XOR
              +------- S
              |
        B -----

        A -----
              |
              |   AND
              +------- C
              |
        B -----
```

**Full Adder**

A full adder adds three binary digits (two significant bits and a carry bit).

- **Inputs**: A, B, Carry-in (Cin)
- **Outputs**: Sum (S), Carry-out (Cout)

**Truth Table for Full Adder**


| A | B | Cin | Sum (S) | Cout |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Logic Circuit for Full Adder**

```
        A -----
              |
              +------- S
              |
        B -----
              |

        A ----+---+
              +--- OR
        B ----+---+

### 9. Explain the Operation of Full Subtractor and Half Subtractor Logic Circuit

**Half Subtractor**

A half subtractor subtracts two bits and produces a difference and borrow.

- **Inputs**: A, B
- **Outputs**: Difference (D), Borrow (B)

**Truth Table for Half Subtractor**


| A | B | Difference (D) | Borrow (B) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

**Logic Circuit for Half Subtractor**

```
        A -----
              |
              +------- D
              |
        B -----

        A -----
              |
              +--- NOT
                  |
                  +--- AND
                  +------- B
                  |
        B -----

**Full Subtractor**

A full subtractor subtracts two bits along with an input borrow.

- **Inputs**: A, B, Borrow-in (Bin)
- **Outputs**: Difference (D), Borrow-out (Bout)

**Truth Table for Full Subtractor**


| A | B | Bin | Difference (D) | Bout |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| ... |  |  |  |  |

(Complete the table similarly as above.)

             +---- XOR ----- D
       B ----- 
             +
